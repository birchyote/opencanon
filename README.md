# Welcome to the Open Canon project!

Presented henceforth is the idea of an open literary canon.
In rejection of claims to ownership or copyright, the narrative of stories and works within the canon
will be inexorably linked in a total common reality. When, for example, a chapter of textual fiction
is submitted to the canon, it will immediately be expandable by any author wishing to contribute to the canon!
Within a unified fictional existence, it is the belief of the authors of the canon that creativity will flourish. 

This repo represents a primary collection of all the stories, images, videos, resource files etc that make up the open canon!
