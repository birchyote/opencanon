this directory is dedicated to the exclusive use of the
"JUST_WRITE" bash script i created for the purposes of
self encouragement. 
feel free to copy the script into your own JUST_WRITE
directory if youre a linux user who thinks highly of the capability
to run such a script and capture pure, train of thought,
stream of consciousness standard input and fold format it
into a space-broken text file timestamped with the date.

also, if you can make the script better, go ahead.
im new to bash. =3

i could make a batch script for the windows users, too.
ill have to brush up on batch. been a while.
