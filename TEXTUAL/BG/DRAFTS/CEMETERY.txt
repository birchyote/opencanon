[CONTENT WARNINGS: death, implied  corpse mutilation / cannibalization]
draft as of dec 21 2023

﻿BACKGROUND/DRAFT LORE:
Furthering concepts of time, linearity, cycles, death, growth, being, will write a series of short chapters inspired by corresponding tracks of King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard's 6th studio album Paper Mache dream Balloon , detailing maintenance of a cemetery and additionally hobby digging and construction of a series of underground chambers nearby (which survive into the era of Volantran colonization of earth, later located in the arc I plan inspired by "House of Four Doors" by The Moody Blues

Sense: Dialogue between two characters: cemetery keeper and his friend who attends a funeral with him to help him lower the casket. Regarding the idea of burying dead. On different pages but unaware , groundskeeper subtly insinuating the meat and body is wasted, friend only talking about the bizarre nature of psuedo disposal , underground preservation


Bone: Contents of a manic manifesto written by groundskeeper regarding his infatuation with carrion, decay, death, (continues into "Dirt")


Dirt: (cont.) soil, decomposition, and carrion.


Paper Mache Dream Balloon: Internal thought process of a hobby digger who is carving underground chambers nearby the cemetery, interrupted by a phone call regarding late payment and debt collection.


Trapdoor: (tentative) recollections by attendees of the funeral as to the behavior of the groundskeeper, regarding his actions taken towards freshly buried cadavers


Cold Cadaver: Groundskeeper's partner's recollection of groundskeeper's moral character, implied to be to a court in defense (and gradually realized offense) of/against Groundskeeper.


The Bitter Boogie: character (who? hobby digger? groundskeeper?) trying to get a large amount of cash back at a convenience store, snapping at the cashier when questioned


N.G.R.I: perpetrator of a murder observing in great detail their surroundings after disassembling someone, attempting to rationalize it as a dream or nonreality


Time = Fate: someone (groundskeeper?) struggling violently with the concept of linearity versus cyclic time and reality, trying to reconcile their desire to destruct, searching for a loophole or exception in their newly obtained multiple life sentences


Time = $$$: (tentative) dealing between two people of meat, discussion of aging in relation to cost


Most of What I Like:


Paper Mache: (tentative) full formatted police report on various redacted illegal incidents that occurred at the cemetery

The cemetery is just off of the somewhat-new Taft-Volantran spaceport, within the 
minor of the two major pedway bends, a small area cordoned off for outdoor use… A 
small park remains nearby strangled by rows of high class eateries, and overpriced 
local breweries. Nightlife is substantial in the late evening and into the twilight 
hours of the weekend, but right now it’s as bright as could be, the sun directly 
overhead, and this groundskeeper is badly hungover. Sickly, I overlook the scarce 
patrons, the staggering midday drunk who tended to hang around the park longer than 
necessary, in my opinion, for a good, high quality buzz. The few folks putzing 
around during the day were like ants, scrambling, slowly, scouting fresh carrion. I 
checked over to my right to confirm he was still there, yes, my good friend, whose 
name eludes me. He works down the way, loads the space-shit cargo. Damn astro-birds 
bringing those tall grays in and out. He was watching me, looking. He wanted to say 
something, I’m sure.


How could I forget his name? My best friend, groundskeeper of the cemetery beside 
my very place of work, and I forgot his name. Dear, what a fool, no, a… What’s that 
word? Crass? I’m not sure.

He just looked over to me, having observed that park for a while now. Does he want 
me to say something? I’ve already been rude in my head, forgetting his damn name, I 
might as well remain polite in the real world.

“So, why’d you bring me out here? Just wanted me to keep guard while the grieving 
widowers have him lowered into the ground here?”

Hopefully I kept my voice down enough. I hope that wasn't too loud. I always hate 
when I’m out somewhere and people are being loud as fuck… That’s an overreaction! 
No need for such language, oh God… Well, anyways, he seems to be thinking that 
over. I was just ad libbing to kill the silence between us, but why did he invite 
me here anyway? I never knew this dead guy or any of his wives. Maybe that’s rude. 
I don't disrespect the polygamists, I really don't… 

							“I needed help lowering the casket.”
Damn guy, I told him that on the phone call this morning. Fuckin’ kids these days, 
what the hell? You tell them one thing and it just drips out their dick by the 
afternoon. He probably sucked off that damn USB stick one too many times on the way 
over. Always forgetting shit, write it down if you need to, you… whatever your name 
is. Maybe I should ask him to the park after this. The crowd over there seems to be 
letting up their attention from that deadbeat preacher, yeah buddy, glance my way. 
Don’t think I don't recognize you from that sketchy psychic bazaar we locked eyes 
at last night… all hypocrites, these biblical boasting boarminded… whatever, 
there’s not enough insulting words that start with a B. over on my right here this 
guy seems to be recalling our arrangement, yeah, gotcha buddy. You owe me one from 
deflecting those damn cops from your little backyard project here a few weeks back. 
Maybe he already forgot about that favor, too! Ungrateful, this younger generation. 
How old is he, anyway?

        That’s it! He invited me here, calling in that favor I owed him, to help 
him lower that casket. I wonder why the bereaved are having us do it? Too 
difficult, maybe. I could see that. God be with them… What hard times! The 
groundskeeper stolidly drags on a cigarette. It’s smooth, a satisfying taste, even 
secondhand. I haven’t smoked in a while, no, but that calms the nerves for certain. 
Standing there in the sweeping breeze he looks old… Maybe the smoke settles the 
light, accentuating the folds of the face. It was his, what, thirty… thirty eighth 
birthday, recently? Or was it coming up? Shit, I must be old now, too, we were in 
the same highschool class… Oh, bother, there I go with the language again. Lord 
forgive…

His finger was tapping, tapping just now on his pocket. There it goes again. Is he 
that eager for another smoke? Didn’t even finish this one. It’s making me itchy, 
gotta look over here. The women were mostly dressed in fanciful black dresses. 
Startlingly, the groundskeeper emerges from the limit of my peripheral.
        Alright, time to bury this fucker. Cigarette stomped out, one last 
exhalation, Marlboro is the best bitch I’ve ever loved. She gets me. Fuck, 
hopefully this kid picks up on following me, I can’t lower that shit myself. I 
remember this guy, he’s no bodybuilder… Well, I suppose he did build quite a bit of 
body near the end there. Damn I’m funny. Should’ve been a comedian, this job 
fucking sucks. Luckily he followed me over here. The other two guys were already at 
their ends of the ribbon. I gesture the guy over to hold his. Easy enough job. Now 
that I think of it, he’s fucking lucky I only called in that favor for something 
this easy, I saved that guy from a lot of shit! There’s no reasonable excuse for 
fucking around here that late. None at all. Anyways, I know myself he’s too clean 
and kind a guy to do anything shady. Very dependable, godly man. 


Alright, damn thing in the ground. These people throwing the dirt in always bug me. 
I know you’re no professional but damn, you never shovel anything before? This was 
your husband. Work on that damn posture at least.
The actual lowering went faster than I figured. Easier, too.

4: Title Track
“Really shit the bed at work today, honestly,”


He was scraping at the clay wall within the farthest end of the chamber, utilizing 
a flat stone. It was a shallow, even stone, almost pear-shaped. The wider side was 
wicked in mud, of course.


“I know it was my fault, obviously. Yeah. The lines were switched by no one but me, 
that’s really the short and simple of it. Yeah. I know. I don’t know. I feel bad of 
course. I’ll miss the pay, too, I’m sorry.”


He was of the opinion the soil, even at this depth, was a richness no other 
material had yet achieved. It was a solid structure of life’s beginning, though he 
lamented the terminology of possession. Piercingly, the phone rang within the 
pocket of the long, stained pants he adorned. He flipped it open to answer.


“Yeah?”


The other end was fuzzy sounding, which made sense at such a depth beneath the 
surface:


“Hey. Sounds like you’re digging. Should I call back later?”


“No, whatever.”


He was digging.
