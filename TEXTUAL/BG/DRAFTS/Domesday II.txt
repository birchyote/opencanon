﻿Miniscule rocks spattered out into the surrounding field grass, fleeing the path of the 
nearly worn tires of the small green car. Before the front of the heavily battered hood sprawls the 
open road which terminates perpendicular to the absolute horizon. Clouds encroach the sky 
overhead, and behind the two occupants of the car, a backseat of supplies jostles lightly with the 
rumbling of machinated traversal. 
        The driver, owner, and maintainer of this car is a human named Maxwell. His hands, the 
descended hands of the ancestral primate, hold the steering wheel in a fatigue most would state 
resultant of overexertion of the gripping force.
        In the passenger seat, Seth, the best friend of the driver in question, was currently 
gazing out upon the lightly rolling hills passing him by, while lazily speaking his mind…


        “So, it’s just that kind of thing that always- it’s just something I always feel like. It’s 
infuriating sometimes, but mostly I just want to cry. Because it’s not right, you know?”


        Maxwell half-listened, half-replied:


        “Your body?”


        “My body. My form, too.”


        “Those are separate?”


        “They’re separate. And they’re both wrong. Wrong, well, not right. I don’t know about 
wrong. I’m not sure.”


        The whirring motor challenges their following silence.


        “So… Seth,”


        “Yeah?”


        He seemed sort of perturbed as he glanced over to meet Max’s inquiry. 


        “Seth… You’re sure you have to talk to this guy, right?


        “He’s my fucking friend. I know you don’t like him or whatever, but this is important to 
me, I don’t want you to make this a whole-”


        “Yeah, okay, okay, I’m sorry. I was just… making sure. I’m sorry.”


        The whirring motor.
