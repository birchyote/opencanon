	Lines draw from all places into the heart of one, lone perusing the catalog 
of all Things, collected slowly in a life average.
	A being is hence titled The Keeper of All, Reader of Words and Viewer of 
Images unseen, the Hearer of Sounds and endless unsung noise from all sources.
	The catalog of all things is vast and unending, without temporal boundary. 
Infinite silvered discs reflect their instructions. Fibers of the once living hold 
fast the symbols of text. Ferrous platters spin their numerals thus forth. 
	Yet The Keeper is not without inquiry. 


	        “How is the meaning of all things strewn within seemingly unending 
meaningless form? Every text, image, recording and video is without total 
connection. How am I to Keep all that is Known only by observing that which is 
Created?”

	In Form there lay an answer:


						“All things are Created from that which Exists. 
						None was ever new but the Origin of Logic. 
							Nothing can be created from nonexistence. 
					In ways nearly imperceptible, all Things are One. 
	It is the greatest falsity in this world, to think that anything is not One.
Only when You come to know all Things, will You understand what it is to be One.”


	The Keeper knew not what had to be known. Only that knowledge must be built. 
To obtain One, to realize the Purpose of All Things, to understand Origin. Beyond 
that which is Known by all, is the innumerable everything. To realize Oneness is 
the greatest of all Things.


	So, The Keeper kept perusing. Learning from text, Hearing from recordings, 
Viewing every seemingly meaningless image and video, and doing everything in search 
of the greatest of all:




									One.
