﻿Life is a scourge on reality. 
His eyes hunt around the room, grappling for something to latch their gaze to. 
Flesh litters the area. The air is thickly stained by the visceral, pungent odor of 
blood. Torn muscle meat, flayed, lay in piles on the floor, seeping the thick fluid 
it has remaining. Neat slices of stale dermis lined up orderly on a long table. All 
evidence of the most beautiful thing of all, the removal of the contamination. The 
purification had already begun by his hand. 
The hand, an adequate tool. Near universal. Its dexterity is unmatched by anything 
created by man.
        An ample salary enables him to stay within a low profile. Then again, many 
consider the ones he targets as subhuman. More like shooting wildlife. Less stringy

a single flume, a tiny delicious treat for the soul, delectable to taste and feel. 
O, the feeling…
        He recalls it to his mind gently. The softness and the wetness. Warmth for 
a while, then cooled by entropy. Sliding into the tissue via a small score, a slit 
which he pushes into an expanse by force. Feeling the tearing around him lightly. 
Carefully, he brings his mind back, so as not to get carried away. He has a task to 
accomplish.
        He longs for a greater cleanse, and today, his catalyst is completed. He 
made it during some off time at work. Reprogramming some RNA, precisely inscribing 
the code.
