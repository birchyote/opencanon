﻿The rasp ticky-tacking was something that always bothered. Boss always loved 
clicking that pen incessantly while we met. The peeks his face made beyond my 
quarterly review were always enigmatic. 
Four pages in, and he hadn't said yet another word after his “Hello, Rich.” That 
was me, of course. My sales were lackluster as of late.


“Son, you're falling behind. Why?”
He always echoed rhetoric. 


“Well, analysts predict recession soon and,”


“No. Bullshit. You knew that when you were called to my office. No bullshit.” 
He had set the review down now, turning that swivel chair to gaze out the window 
and speak: “Do you see all that? Down there? Watch the cars drive. Do you 
understand how this world functions? Our world… Every car down there, every train 
on every track worthwhile, in this godless country, they slide around, bellies full 
of oil. Our product. We sell the lifeblood this world operates on.”


He looked at me smiling at his monologue. Meeting my gaze, his joy dissolved into 
placidity, as if witnessing some mediocre talk show. 
I always knew I was nothing under him. 


“With this in mind, son, you're going to explain to me why you can't make it work. 
A quarter billion in R&D this year alone, formulating these… new, ‘improved 
efficiency’ fuels. Dodging, with tact, every environmentalist group crying about 
our thankless work. We tied it up in a ribbon for you. Everyone’s sales are up, or 
steady. Why can't you move this lifeblood?”


Something changed. It could've been some time down the years ledging contracts, 
heeding memos, ascending four thousand stairs to my office when the elevators were 
down. I stood up, looking at him. I turned around and walked out of the office.
