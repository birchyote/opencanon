[EDITOR’S NOTE: holy fuck this reads like ayn rand. Need to rework it entirely I think. Way too self righteous. Fuck you, rand.]



THREE CONCENTRIC SQUARES.
AN ALL-SEEING CENTER.
A LOWER CUBE UPON WHICH IT RESTS.


THIS IS THE MESSIAH.
________________
A MAN WAS WALKING TO HIS PLACE OF OFFERING. 
HE GAVE IT THIS: 
A SLAB OF MEAT, FROM THE FINEST CONSUMER MARKET IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, AS ALL OTHERS 
APPROACHING THE PLACE OF OFFERING DID. 
MESSIAH WAS DEPICTED HERE, ON THE WALL OF STONE, FOUR-SIDED, WITH A SHORTER SLAB ON 
EACH SIDE. 
SUCH WAS THE PLACE OF OFFERING.


PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL AROUND: 
MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN, 
PEOPLE OF ALL TYPES, OF WHICH THERE WERE SCARCELY FEW. 
THIS IS WHERE THEY GATHERED, 
AND PLACED THEIR MEAT UPON THE STONE SLABS. 
THE ROOM WHICH CONTAINED THE PLACE OF OFFERING WAS AT THE CENTRE OF THE WORLD: 
THERE WAS NO CLOSER PLACE TO SINGULARITY. 
THE LINES OF PEOPLE STRETCHED LONG TO ENTER, 
AND ONCE THE OFFERING WAS MADE, TO LEAVE.


A MAN PLACES HIS SLAB OF RED MEAT - 
TENDER FILET OF FLESH - 
UPON THE EASTWARD PLATFORM. 
IT IS ASSIMILATED BY MEANS OF LIGHT, AND HE IS HAPPY.


A MAN PASSES ANOTHER. 
HE IS SPEAKING IN TONGUES. 
HE CHANTS REPEATEDLY, IN ANSWER TO MESSIAH,
“YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES!”
THIS MAKES THE MAN HAPPY.
THE MAN SPEAKING IN TONGUES APPROACHES HIS END.
IT IS A GLORIOUS CONCLUSION.
SOON, VULTURES OF MEN APPEAR, 
RETRIEVING THE CADAVER. 


A GLORIOUS, GLORIOUS WORLD - GLORY, GLORY, 
TO THE WORLD, 
AND TO MESSIAH.


just a crack of light.
just a crack of light,
O revealing, through the darkness it cuts,
and in its perfection, it reveals.
it shines down upon the sharp-cut stone world,
and it reveals the white wall of solitude. 
the wall is smooth, 
and it perfectly intersects the floor at ninety degrees.
this is what the light revealed.


a man was alone when it appeared.
just a crack of light.
of light.
of light.
Light.


a man looked to his translucent flesh.
his immensely large pupils, 
suited for the darkness of the world,
hardly adjusted to the blinding ray.
the only time light should exist,
is from the Messiah accepting an offering.
why 
was there light
here?


a man looked out the crack, into the light.
he spent hours blinking to adjust.
beyond the wall, a place that should not be real,
it was brown, jagged scraps throughout.
small, misshapen men covered in fluff scattered around.
the source of the crack was there.
a twisted metal heap, steaming in the wreckage.
bent not in malformity, but of its very design.


a man disregarded this.
the unknown was what he sought.
a man
ventured outside
the walls of his world

Slow at first then running running running so fast faster than ever before and 
stopped and heaving and resting below a strange brown pillar and then again up and 
running and the fluid in the firmament of his was filling his chest and then out 
and then back in and he was free.


Free from what?


Soon the Messiah in the sky fled below the horizon and the man was scared and alone 
and clueless of fact.


A strangely shaped man, on four legs and with no arms approached him. Curiously. 
The man on four legs had yellowing pillars of still lightning topping his head.
A long face, black rough of a nose, eyes all-black beads.
Covered in brown hairs, white spots.


The creature fled at his movement.


A man laid down upon the ground. The eyes closed, the sound soon drifting into 
nothingness, and
________________




The Messiah rose again from below the horizon. A man awoke.


The man felt alone. 


He looked down to his right. There lay a rectangular prism, transparent, scratched, 
and buffed, with softened edges. Scraps of fabric, seemingly torn apart, surround 
it.
Trapped within the object was a triad of flat green near-rhombi, connected by short 
green stalks.
