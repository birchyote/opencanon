[EDITOR'S NOTE:
this is some kind of scene i was writing for use in 400ppm. idk why it has its own
little document and doesnt live in the random ideas document i maintain, but...
here it is. i really don't know where or when ill ever end up putting this into
the final version of 400ppm. i envisioned it occuring behind my old
elementary school.]

shoe bottoms sends them firing to the sides.


“You know bees were recently added to the list of endangered species?”
“Yes.”
“It’s concerning. Concerning to me, at least…
Hey, my backpack feels lighter. I know I removed that one thing I didn’t need 
anymore, but I didn’t think it was that heavy?”


There was a coolness to the brisk flow of air that surrounded them. Was it strange 
for it to be this cold during the late spring season? Neither of them could 
remember. It was a time before theirs that seasons were natural.
