[EDITOR'S NOTE: feel free to copy this character information template.
i summed it up, keeping it oriented toward character content rather than title.
also, this document is pretty spread out and has a ton of characters that
will probably never show up in a chapter, and certainly many that do not even show up
in any drafts yet! so, um... enjoy?]
